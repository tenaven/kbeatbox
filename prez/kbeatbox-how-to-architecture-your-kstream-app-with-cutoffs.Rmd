 Maybe present a whole usecase with data and all...

### Abstract

Lesson learnt : How to create a replayable system when dealing with postponable cutoffs ?
Replayability is an essential characteristic of your Kafka solution if it needs to be cyber resilient.
This usecase presents :

 * a naive solution and explains where it is wrong
 * an OpenSource solution to reuse in a similar context
 (that has seen production in real-life.)


### Business Value

 * Compliance with cyber resilience regulation ( for e.g. [OICV-IOSCO/Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d146.pdf) )
 * Better quality of software
 * Testable software is software that can easily gain features.
 

# The problem

Cut-off and time barriers is the very come usecase in most business environment :
A lot of IT system are dependant of time related conditions.

### Context : What is a 'cutoff' ?

A cutoff is a business event that changes the business logic.

<!-- TODO: this needs to be illustrated with a diagram  -->

For instance, a End-Of-Year in accounting is a cutoff.
The logic before and after changes : For instance, the way tax computation is changed from one accounting period to the other.
( Say Corporate tax is 31% in 2018, and then it is 28% in 2019. Any resemblance to actual countries, or actual events is purely coincidental.)

A cutoff can be postponed, based on a decision by an operator.
( The CFO, the chief accountant, the tax administration, court decision, etc... )

# How do people code that naively ?

### 
\huge{How do people code that naively}

### Naive but seen in real-life code

```java
// DO NOT DO THAT !!!
if (System.currentTimeMillis() > MY_PREDEFINED_CUTOFF) {
    changeEverythingInHowTheSystemWorksPastThatCUTOFF();
}
// DO NOT DO THAT !!!
```

## First problem: accessing system time

### First problem: accessing system time

Unless you really know what you are doing, accessing directly system time is a big NO NO :

It can not be replayed.

Likewise, using ```TimerTask``` is a bad idea.


### Rather than accessing the system time, use event time.

If you work with Kafka, it is very important that you get to the bottom of that :

[Kafka concepts of time](https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/concepts.html#time)

$\rightarrow$ Event-time is the right choice.

### Reminder : What's event time ?


\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
Upstream, you need a timemarker producing scheduler, KBeatbox takes as input :

\begin{itemize}
 \item \makebox[2.7cm]{Event time\hfill} Real time when the event/data item was created
 \item \makebox[2.7cm]{Ingestion time\hfill} System time when the data item was received
 \item \makebox[2.7cm]{Processing Time\hfill} System time when the data item is processed
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.40\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{img/processing-vs-event-time.pdf}
\end{column}
\end{columns}


### Why ? Testing, testing, testing

time-dependent systems are difficult to test :

 * Identical replay simply does not work !
 * You cannot easily change the system time, because system time changes impact the whole machine.
 * It is possible to change the system time in a VM through.
 * System time cannot be accelerated easily.


### Java offers some mocking ability to some extent

 * Using Clock in java.time
 * Using Aspect-Oriented Programming
 * Using Mocks

See : https://www.baeldung.com/java-override-system-time

### But java mocks are not applicable in acceptance

But what about acceptance testing ? $\rightarrow$ still an issue.

### Kafka's replay capabilities make testing easy

What's great about Kafka is its ability to replay anything ( production, acceptance...)

For acceptance testing it is a fantastic ability, you can save the logs from previous days of production/acceptance,
and compare the results in time as your software evolves.

( e.g. how is behaving version 1.15 in comparison with version 1.14 on the exact same input ?)

Spotting the differences between versions is a simple binary diff provided the system is :

 * Deterministic (no race conditions for instance)
 * Not system time dependent (Expected this one ? )
 * No threading effect
 * One-input-to-one-output

### Naive code

```java
// DO NOT DO THAT !!!
if (System.currentTimeMillis() > MY_PREDEFINED_CUTOFF) {
    changeEverythingInHowTheSystemWorksPastThatCUTOFF();
}
// DO NOT DO THAT !!!
```

## Second problem: cut-off may be postponed


### MY_PREDEFINED_CUTOFF constant : not postponable

Comparing the event-time with a constant MY_PREDEFINED_CUTOFF is a bad idea :

It means the cut-off can not be postponed.



# A canned solution : Kbeatbox

###

\Huge{Solution : Kbeatbox}


### Good practice : Decouple, use logical time

Idea : Rather than access time directly, send messages in the input kafka topic to symbolize the advance of time :

# How does KBeatbox work

### An OSS library, Kbeatbox comprises :

 * heartbeat generator
 * kbeartbox scheduler

### Making timemarkers with Kbeatbox

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.25\textwidth}
Upstream, you need a timemarker producing scheduler, KBeatbox takes as input :
\begin{itemize}
 \item heartbeats messages 
 \item command messages
 \item produces your timemarkers.
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.75\textwidth}
\includegraphics[height=8cm]{img/kbeatbox.pdf}
\end{column}
\end{columns}



###

\tenaven{} values feedback :

 * Do you think kbeatbox could be reused in your business/mission ?
 * Do you believe replay is an important feature of Kakfa ? 
 * Do you feel it is utilized enough at your workplace ?
 * Do you have any other question ?

### Appendix

### What is a Mealy finite-state machine ?

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.2\textwidth}
\includegraphics[height=4cm]{img/wsCuZy.png} 
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.8\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item  It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.   
\item The transition from one state to another is in response to a sequence of inputs. It is defined by a list of \textbf{states}, \textbf{initial state}, and \textbf{conditions or triggers} for each transition. 
\item Because of the \textit{simplicity} of its interfaces and its \textit{determinism}, Mealy finite-state machines are easy to test thoroughly.
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

### Actions in Transition

* send an event
* receive an event
* start a timer (schedule)
* cancel a timer
* start another state machine
* decision or acknowledgement

\includegraphics[height=0.9\textheight]{img/kbeatbox_state_diagram.pdf}

### Unique features of KBeatBox

* Input events run idempotently – multiple schedules for the same heartBeat has the same effect as a single schedule, ( s * e1 * e1 = s * e1 ).
* Deterministic - every state has exactly one transition for each possible input.
* Time is **purely logical**. Having a logical time rather than using a wall clock time directly is a huge advantage for testing. Example vector clock.
* Logic is concise and precise as such, presents no edgecases.
* Events are chainable, loggable, and replayable.
* Event cannot be removed before it is scheduled.
* Does not run a scheduled task before it receives a heartbeat (this means we cannot add task from the past).
* Able to receive AckEvent, and add events to a chain of AckEvents.
* Cannot reschedule or remove a task that is already running. 

### Idempotence

Any write operation should always produce the same result for a given number of input parameters no matter the number of requests. This feature ensures consistency in heartbeat events. 


### Purely logical time 

* Time is purely logical : 
    * There is no access to the CPU clock.
    * Time elapsed is provided through heartbeat messages (that contains an integer) and cause-consequence modelling between tasks. 
    * It also means the KBeatBox code uses a purely deterministic logic (no side effect from CPU clock). KBeatBox acts deterministically solely on the input it receives.
    * This allows for easy replayability (everything can be logged). 
    * This allows for easy testing.

### Logic : Layered organisation of logic

\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}c}
\small 946 lines of scala logic, structured in layers & \\ 
\small Each layer is responsible for one purpose and is tested independently & \includegraphics[height=0.8\textheight, valign=t]{img/FSMclassdiagram.pdf} \\
\end{tabular}


### Limitations

Time is logged so there is a limit on the  granularity of time (few heartBeats)


### KBeatBox vs Open Source Schedulers

\arrayrulecolor{black} 

| Scheduler  | Main Language  | Files | Blank | Comment  | Code
|------------|----------------|-------|-------|----------|---------
| PagerDuty  | Scala          | 88 | 1145 | 700 | 6068
| Criteo Cuttle | JS, Scala   | 55 ; 37 | 697 ; 678 | 177 ; 670 | 8163 ; 3793
| Quckoo     |  Scala         | 360 | 5142 | 6489 | 16064
|  KBeatBox  |  Scala         | 15 | 212 |344 | 823 

\arrayrulecolor{white} 

### Roadmap

* Ack Timeout (== NACK??? or different component)
* Gui – be able to display states, current events, past events, ackevent, schedule, and reschedule.
* Differentiate events and processes (or not events are just empty processes)
* Cancelling of task
* Synchronous scheduling
* Actual deployment on kafkastreams
