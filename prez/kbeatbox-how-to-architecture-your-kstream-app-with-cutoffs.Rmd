# Introduction

Cut-off and time barriers is the very come usecase in most business environment :
A lot of IT system are dependant of time related conditions.


### Key point : accessing directly the wallclock time of your machine is a no go.

Unless you really know what you are doing, accessing the directly time is a big NO NO.

```


```


### Why ? Testing, testing, testing

### What is a Mealy finite-state machine ?

\begin{column}{0.8\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item  It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.   
\item The transition from one state to another is in response to a sequence of inputs. It is defined by a list of \textbf{states}, \textbf{initial state}, and \textbf{conditions or triggers} for each transition. 
\item Because of the \textit{simplicity} of its interfaces and its \textit{determinism}, Mealy finite-state machines are easy to test thoroughly.
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

### Actions in Transition

* send an event
* receive an event
* start a timer (schedule)
* cancel a timer
* start another state machine
* decision or acknowledgement

### Unique features of KBeatBox

* Input events run idempotently – multiple schedules for the same heartBeat has the same effect as a single schedule, ( s * e1 * e1 = s * e1 ).
* Deterministic - every state has exactly one transition for each possible input.
* Time is **purely logical**. Having a logical time rather than using a wall clock time directly is a huge advantage for testing. Example vector clock.
* Logic is concise and precise as such, presents no edgecases.
* Events are chainable, loggable, and replayable.
* Event cannot be removed before it is scheduled.
* Does not run a scheduled task before it receives a heartbeat (this means we cannot add task from the past).
* Able to receive AckEvent, and add events to a chain of AckEvents.
* Cannot reschedule or remove a task that is already running. 

### Idempotence

Any write operation should always produce the same result for a given number of input parameters no matter the number of requests. This feature ensures consistency in heartbeat events. 


### Purely logical time 

* Time is purely logical : 
    * There is no access to the CPU clock.
    * Time elapsed is provided through heartbeat messages (that contains an integer) and cause-consequence modelling between tasks. 
    * It also means the KBeatBox code uses a purely deterministic logic (no side effect from CPU clock). KBeatBox acts deterministically solely on the input it receives.
    * This allows for easy replayability (everything can be logged). 
    * This allows for easy testing.

### Logic : Layered organisation of logic

\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}c}
\small 946 lines of scala logic, structured in layers & \\ 
\small Each layer is responsible for one purpose and is tested independently & \includegraphics[height=0.8\textheight, valign=t]{img/FSMclassdiagram.pdf} \\
\end{tabular}


### Limitations

Time is logged so there is a limit on the  granularity of time (few heartBeats)


### KBeatBox vs Open Source Schedulers

\arrayrulecolor{black} 

| Scheduler  | Main Language  | Files | Blank | Comment  | Code
|------------|----------------|-------|-------|----------|---------
| PagerDuty  | Scala          | 88 | 1145 | 700 | 6068
| Criteo Cuttle | JS, Scala   | 55 ; 37 | 697 ; 678 | 177 ; 670 | 8163 ; 3793
| Quckoo     |  Scala         | 360 | 5142 | 6489 | 16064
|  KBeatBox  |  Scala         | 15 | 212 |344 | 823 

\arrayrulecolor{white} 

### Roadmap

* Ack Timeout (== NACK??? or different component)
* Gui – be able to display states, current events, past events, ackevent, schedule, and reschedule.
* Differentiate events and processes (or not events are just empty processes)
* Cancelling of task
* Synchronous scheduling
* Actual deployment on kafkastreams
